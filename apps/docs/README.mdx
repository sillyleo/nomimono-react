## Installation

```zsh
pnpm install nomimono
```

## Usage

In your file, import the components you need:

```jsx
import { Button } from "nomimono";
```
Initialize css reset in `index.tsx` or `app.tsx`, where all compoenets can access:

```jsx
import { reset } from "nomimono";
// css reset
reset();
```


For dark theme, add `stitchesDarkTheme` class to the root element:

See all component usage here at the [Workshop](https://nomi-workshop.vercel.app/).

## Dark mode

```jsx
import { stitchesDarkTheme } from "nomimono";

<div className={stitchesDarkTheme}>
	{/* Component will display in dark mode */}
</div>;
```

You'll have to implement your own theme switcher.

## Brand Fonts (optional)

> Note: You need to buy the fonts yourself. Without the fonts the components works just fine.

Fonts are optional but prioritize [Sk-Modernist](https://seankanedesign.gumroad.com/l/sk-modernist) for heading and Inter for body.

- [Buy and install SkModernest](https://seankanedesign.gumroad.com/l/sk-modernist) in your project's `public/fonts` folder
- Install Inter with `pnpm i @fontsource/inter-tight`

Initialize brand fonts in your `index.tsx` or `app.tsx`, where all compoenets can access:

```jsx
import { brandFonts } from "nomimono";
//set up fonts (optional)
brandFonts();
```

## Inter Tight

Get it from google fonts or install as an NPM package:

```zsh
pnpm install @fontsource/inter-tight
```

In your `index.tsx` or `app.tsx`:

```jsx
import "@fontsource/inter-tight"
```
