# Tailwind version

There's an experimentail version of button called `TailwinButton`. Powered by the excellent [tailwind-variants](https://www.tailwind-variants.org/) library.

```jsx
import {TailwindButton} from "nomimono"
import "nomimono/style"

<TailwindButton>Button</TailwindButton>
```

It has zero-dependency and is very small. However, it's not very customizable, lacking tones and dark mode needs manual work.

Once the `tailwind-variants` library is stable, I'll migrate components to use it.
